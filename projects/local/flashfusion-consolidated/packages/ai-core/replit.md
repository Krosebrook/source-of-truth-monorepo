### August 2, 2025 - Complete Security Vulnerability Remediation

- **Fixed critical XSS vulnerabilities**: Replaced ALL unsafe `innerHTML` usage with secure DOM methods in `api/index.js` (lines 439, 461, 482)
- **Security improvements**: Eliminated all remaining `innerHTML` usage by using `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `textContent` for HTML structure creation
- **Functions secured**: `createAgent()`, `createWorkflow()`, and `addIntegration()` functions now create DOM elements safely
- **Impact**: Removed all XSS attack vectors while maintaining identical functionality and visual appearance
- **Previous fixes confirmed**: `client/dist/agents.js` and other files already properly secured
- **Command injection review**: Verified `spawn()` usage in `start-dev.js` is secure with hardcoded commands and controlled arguments
- **API key audit**: Confirmed no hardcoded API keys in codebase - all references are in documentation templates

### January 30, 2025 - Critical Security Vulnerability Patches Applied

- **Fixed multiple XSS vulnerabilities**: Replaced unsafe `innerHTML` usage with secure DOM methods in legacy files
- **Files patched**: `client/dist/agents.js` and `client/dist/dashboard-interactive.js`
- **Security improvements**: All user-controlled data now safely handled using `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `textContent`
- **Functions secured**: `displayAgents()`, `showAgentDetails()`, `chatWithAgent()`, `sendMessage()`, `displayCodeSnippets()`, `runCode()`, `shareCode()`
- **Impact**: Eliminated all script injection vectors while maintaining full functionality

### January 29, 2025 - Complete Full-Stack Application Built

- **Built comprehensive authentication system**: Implemented secure Replit Auth with session management and PostgreSQL storage

- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket server for instant messaging between users
- **SMS Service**: Twilio integration for SMS messaging capabilities
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components

### Environment Handling

- **Production**: Strict validation for JWT_SECRET, graceful database fallback
- **Development**: Flexible configuration with helpful suggestions
- **Deployment**: Comprehensive validation with detailed error messages

### Security

- JWT_SECRET required in production (auto-generated for development)
- Environment validation prevents deployment with missing critical secrets
- Graceful degradation for optional services
