# Codex Agent

OpenAI code generation integration agent.

## Status

🚧 **Ready for import** - This directory is a placeholder awaiting agent implementation.

## Purpose

This agent will provide unified CLI integration with OpenAI's code generation models (GPT-4, o1, or similar) following the standard agent contract defined in `shared/contracts/`.

**Note**: The directory retains the "codex" name for historical continuity, though OpenAI Codex was deprecated in March 2023. Modern implementations should use current OpenAI models.
