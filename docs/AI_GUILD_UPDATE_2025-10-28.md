# FlashFusion AI Guild Alignment Request — 2025-10-28

## Summary
- Refreshed `/home/kyler/agents.md` into the **FlashFusion Agent Operations Field Guide**, consolidating 2025 governance, lifecycle, and repo hygiene practices.
- Rebuilt `/home/kyler/claude.md` as the **Claude Skills & Operations Playbook**, detailing skill authoring standards, Tool Runner usage, telemetry duties, and safety gates.
- Highlighted deliverable requirements (spec_version 3.1), telemetry expectations, and escalation checkpoints to keep orchestration, skills, evaluators, and auditors aligned.

## Requested Feedback
1. Do the updated orchestrator/skill/tool role definitions reflect current production responsibilities and escalation paths?
2. Are there domain or regional edge cases (billing, fulfillment, compliance) the guides should call out explicitly before the next launch cycle?
3. Does the Tool Runner + evaluator workflow match live practice, including hashing, retries, and human escalation triggers?
4. Any additional checklist items the Agent Guild wants in the **CLAIMS CHECK** sections or telemetry logging requirements?

## Action Items for Agent Guild
- Review the updated guides (`agents.md`, `claude.md`) in the repository root.
- Submit inline comments or log feedback in `docs/AI_GUILD_FEEDBACK.md` by **2025-11-01**.
- Bring open questions and approvals to the next AI Guild sync on **2025-11-02**.
