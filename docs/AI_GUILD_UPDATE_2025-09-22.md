# FlashFusion AI Guild Alignment Request — 2025-09-22

## Summary
- Updated `claude.md` → "FlashFusion × Claude Collaboration Playbook (2025)"
- Updated `agents.md` → "FlashFusion AI Agent System Guidelines (2025)"
- Focus: tighter safety guardrails, reproducible workflows, evaluation pipelines, and human governance checkpoints.

## Requested Feedback
1. Are the engagement modes and decision logs in `claude.md` aligned with current team workflows?
2. Do the revised agent roles, policy snapshots, and deployment gates in `agents.md` cover all critical governance scenarios?
3. Any gaps in security/compliance coverage (e.g., regional regs, audit needs) that should be added before the next release?
   - Incident response escalation ladder (who, when, and audit logging expectations)
   - Regional compliance coverage (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 mappings)
   - Audit log retention cadence and review responsibilities

## Next Steps
- Please review the updated guides in the repo root (`/home/kyler/claude.md`, `/home/kyler/agents.md`).
- Add inline comments via PR review or log feedback in `docs/AI_GUILD_FEEDBACK.md` by **2025-09-26**.
- We will consolidate responses in the weekly AI Guild sync on **2025-09-27**.
